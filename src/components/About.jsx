            <p>I'm originally from Ukraine, currently residing in Brooklyn. I'm inspired by animals (my dog), nature (still my dog), and all things whimsical and cute (in conclusion, my dog). While I've mostly drawn on paper, I have recently begun exploring digital art, which you can see on the site. Thanks for visiting!</p>
